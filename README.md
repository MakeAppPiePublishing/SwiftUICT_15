# Swift UI Complete Training  SwiftUICT_15 - Chapter 15
This is the exercise file for the LinkedIn Learning course *SwiftUI Complete Training* that you can use to follow along with me. If you get stuck working along, you can download the files for the current video to get back on course. 

I've organized this into fifteen downloads, one for each chapter. Download the chapter and decompress the `.zip` file. You will find the videos in that chapter labeled by video number. Refer to the appropriate video for the video number. 

Downloads for this chapter will be different.  This is the capstone project, where you are to make your own app using SwiftUI, a recipe file app.  

There is only two folders for all of chapter 15. The models folder has the files for the models. You'll make your own project and import them.  There is also the completed project, which I'll spend much of this chapter explaining what I did. I've hevily commented this code to make it easier to understand. I use markdown often as Apple documention uses it. if you donr know about markdown/markup you can take a look at my video to help.  https://youtu.be/ZMZjXOzyZBo

**Note:** all files are at least iOS 18.0 without any signing capabilities assigned. With the exception of Chapter 14, which may have iOS versions higher than 18. Those will be marked on the video as to minimum version.
